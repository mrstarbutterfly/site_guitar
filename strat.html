                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <br> <p> In 1996, Fender celebrated its 50th anniversary and was very famous. Musician Eric Clapton asked her to make a special instrument that could compete with other guitars and in the future become a worthy exhibit in the famous museum. So it happened. Erik was shown a gold-plated guitar. It is not known how much he paid for it, but a year later the “beauty” was presented at the auction. The price turned out to be staggering - almost half a million dollars. What allowed to raise the cost - the name of the musician or the name of the brand?

                        <br><p> This rarity left autographs of famous rock musicians. The guitar was sold twice. The first time it was bought by the Qatar family for a million dollars for further transfer to a charitable foundation, and then some generous music fan added another two million seven hundred thousand. The instrument purchased at auction will remain for descendants as the memory of great events in world music. Styles and tastes change, but those people who at one time turned their minds and crossed out the usual framework will be unforgettable.

                        <br><p> This beauty fell into the hands of the famous bluesman Stevie as a gift from his beloved wife and was named after her. The musician never for a moment parted with his favorite instrument until the tragic accident made the heart of the American virtuoso stop. In 2004, at a charity auction, the guitar with an added SRV inscription, meaning the initials of the former owner, was sold.

At a rock concert held in the countryside, famous musicians performed. The audience gathered about 500,000 people. Now it is not known where the guitar is. According to rumors, Paul Allen bought it at auction in 1998 for two million dollars.
