                        <h3>Gibson Les Paul Joe Perry</h3>
                        <br>
                        <hr>
                        <br> <p> The rich, road-worn character of this guitar, is utterly moving, and it seems to throb with the wealth of music and experience earned over decades of being played on stages and in recording studios around the world.
                            “It’s got everything a great Les Paul is supposed to have,” says Perry. “The neck isn’t quite as fat as, say, a ’54 Goldtop, but it’s still got a good, meaty neck. It’s not a high-output guitar, so it’s got a lot of tone … And it’s got all the natural sustain and warmth, and when you turn it up it growls."
                            As stunning a tone monster as this guitar is, however, the story of its passage in and out of Perry’s hands over the years is equally riveting. Slash, Boston-area guitar legend Billy Loosigian and Eric Johnson have all owned this guitar over the years, as it did the rounds through the various ups and downs of Aerosmith’s career.
                            Once it was clear that Joe had made the shift from struggling to thriving as an artist, he sought to recapture his most cherished axe for good. Many years, many phone calls, and many near misses later, this 1959 Les Paul returned to the man who seemed destined to call it his own.
                            Thanks to Gibson Custom and Perry, fans and players can now own the closest possible thing to Joe’s most prized guitar, in the form of one of a very limited run of replicas based on exclusive access to the original.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <br> <p> This one, released in limited edition in 2008, copies the legendary Les Paul, which Jimmy played in the 60s and was stolen from him in 1970. In the original, it was the “black beauty” born in 1960. Jimmy bought this new guitar in a London store in the early 60s and worked on it most of the sessions at the time when he was a studio musician. The most unusual thing on this model was a unique pickup switch. On his copy, Jimmy reworked the switching system. Accordingly, on the cue, it is also quite unusual. A total of 500 guitars were made, the first 25 of which were traditionally tested and signed by Jimmy Page. The price of replicas not signed by Jimmy was $ 8.588. Of course, Paige himself has such a comment (and perhaps not one).

                        <hr>
                        <br><p>Gibson announced the release of a new personalized Custom Shop Les Paul - this time it was Eric Clapton's turn. And in 1966 Clapton to record an album in which there will be more overload than in all previous rock music, he chooses the most suitable guitar for recording - there is no doubt that in this case Les Paul cannot be better. The album then boomed to its fullest and Clapton spawned literally “lespromaniyu” - both professionals including world guitar stars, and amateurs just started to drink the guitar on the secondary market. Seeing such interest in their seemingly forgotten guitars, Gibson decided to resume production of Les Paul at the end of the 60s and did not lose.
